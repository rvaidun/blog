## Introduction
This blog post is intended to describe my trip to Italy in November. We travelled to many cities in relatively short period of time and I wanted to document this to help other travellers plannnig to visit Italy. My itinerary covered the following cities in just 12 days: Milan, Naples (Napoli), Minori in Amalfi Coast, Rome, Florence and Venice. There were points where I felt that some cities were rushed but it hits most of the large tourist sites. I was travelling with 4 friends

# Weather
Weather in Italy during November is pleasant to chilly. You can expect warmer weather in the southern cities during the day and light jacket or sweater should be enough and nights get chillier. When I was there it was averaging 65 F during the day and 45-50 F at night. The northern cities are OK during day and get pretty cold at nights where I needed a sweater and a puffer at most times. In the North weather was around 40-50 F during day and nights were around 35-40 F.

# Milan
My trip started off in Milan since that's where we flew into from San Francisco. We stayed at Ostello Bello Hostel in Milan which was pretty nice
