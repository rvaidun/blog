## Introduction
This blog post is intended to describe my trip to Italy in November. We travelled to many cities in relatively short period of time and I wanted to document this to help other travellers plannnig to visit Italy. My itinerary covered the following cities in just 12 days: Milan, Naples (Napoli), Minori in Amalfi Coast, Rome, Florence and Venice. There were points where I felt that some cities were rushed but it hits most of the large tourist sites. I was travelling with 4 friends

# Weather
Weather in Italy during November is pleasant to chilly. You can expect warmer weather in the southern cities during the day and light jacket or sweater should be enough and nights get chillier. When I was there it was averaging 65 F during the day and 45-50 F at night. The northern cities are OK during day and get pretty cold at nights where I needed a sweater and a puffer at most times. In the North weather was around 40-50 F during day and nights were around 35-40 F.

# Milan (Day 1)
My trip started off in Milan since that's where we flew into from San Francisco. We stayed at [Ostello Bello][ostello-bello] Hostel in Milan which was pretty nice however we definetly paid too much at around 200 euro per night. Location of the Dorm was amazing and it was a few minute walk from main train station in Milan. Airport to Milan is about 50 minute train ride and costs 15 euro pp. Dorm was standard however shower was pretty small which I found was standard in most places in Italy. Hostel was pretty lively at night with full bar and live music.

We only got in around 18:00 and it was already dark so we didn't have time to see much but we checked out [Duomo di Milano][duomo-milan] which was pretty breattaking as you walk out of the train station but the surrounding area is a big tourist trap. We payed 22 euro pp for Aperol Spritz ðŸ’€. First night we had a nice pizza over at [Berbere pizza][berbere-pizza] which didn't break the bank, followed by a nice chill night at the hostel.

# Lake Como (Day 2)
On Day 2 after a leisure morning we made a day trip over to Lake Como. From Milan Centrale station Lake Como is only a 40 minute journey. Once we got to Lake Como we spent about an hour walking around the Lake seeing all the shops and restaurants in the area. The Lake is beautiful and massive and there are many boats and ferries taking you to the small towns located all over the Lake.

After a lil cappucino and bottle of wine we bought at a local wine shop we took the Furnicular to a higher point and got a nice view of the Lake from the top. There are some restaurants at the top but we didn't spend too much time there since we had booked a Ferry ride to Bellagio. The ferry ride was not too expensive and it was a nice way to see the Lake. The town of Bellagio was cool and I saw the resemblance to the Bellagio casino in Las Vegas whose designers took inspiration from this town. After walking around the town for an hour we had a small lunch at some pasta restaurant ([Dai Viga Pasta Fresca][pasta-como]) which was honestly some of the most mid pasta I've had.

Afterwards we took another ferry ride to the town of Varenna where we enjoyed the sunset and had another cappucino, I slightly became a cappucino addict on this trip averaging 2 a day. We took the train back to Milan Centrale from Varenna which was ~50 minutes but the train was completely stuffed the whole ride to Milan. Didn't do much today in Milan just went took a fat nap and woke up for dinner at [SPICE VILLAGE MILANO][spice-village-milano] which was alright indian food, not the greatest.

# Milan -> Napoli (Day 3)
Day 3 we woke up pretty early around 5:30 AM as we had booked a 6 AM train from Milan to Napoli through Italo, Italy's high speed train company. The train we took was going at 300 KM/hour and reached Naples around Noon. We rented a car in Naples since our AirBnB was in the Amalfi Coast in the small town of Minori just south of the city of Amalfi. From Naples to Minori it is about an hour drive
